The Drums of Thunder

Raijin's most distinctive attribute is his ring of drums, known as 'Taiko'. He carries these drums on his back or floats surrounded by them in a ring.

Thunder Creation:
By striking these drums with his hammers/drumsticks, Raijin creates the sound of thunder that rolls across the sky. Each drum beat sends a shockwave that we hear as the rumble of a storm.

Symbolism:
The drums are decorated with the 'Tomoe' (巴) symbol, usually a Mitsudomoe (three comma shapes swirling in a circle). This symbol represents the cycle of life, the play of forces in the cosmos, and the trinity of heaven, earth, and humanity. It is strongly associated with Shinto shrines and the thunder god himself.

Power:
The drums are not just instruments but weapons of divine power. They channel the raw energy of the storm. In some legends, the sound of his drums can summon rain to end droughts, making him a vital deity for agriculture and farmers.
