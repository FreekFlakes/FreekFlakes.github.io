Folklore & Superstitions

Raijin is a figure of both fear and respect in Japanese culture.

Hide Your Belly Button!
One of the most famous superstitions involving Raijin is the warning parents give to children during thunderstorms: "Hide your belly button!" (Kaminari-sama ga heso o tori ni kuru). It is said that Raijin loves to eat human navels (belly buttons), so you must cover your stomach to protect yourself. This folklore likely originated as a way to ensure children stayed warm and didn't expose their stomachs to the sudden temperature drops that accompany rainstorms.

The God Catcher
There is a legend about Sugaru, the "God Catcher," who was ordered by the Emperor to catch the Thunder God to stop a storm. Sugaru prayed and then, with divine help, managed to bind Raijin, bringing him to the palace only to have the Emperor release him in exchange for ending the storms.

Temples and Statues
Statues of Raijin (often paired with Fujin, the Wind God) guard the entrances of many shrines and temples in Japan, most famously the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate) of Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa, Tokyo. Standing there, they protect the sacred space from evil spirits and storms.
