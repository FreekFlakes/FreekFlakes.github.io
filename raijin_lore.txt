Raijin (雷神), also known as Kaminari-sama (雷様) or Raiden-sama (雷電様), is a god of lightning, thunder, and storms in Japanese mythology and the Shinto religion.

The name "Raijin" is derived from the Japanese words "rai" (thunder) and "shin" or "jin" (god). He is typically depicted as a demon-looking spirit beating drums to create thunder, usually with the symbol 'tomoe' drawn on the drums.

Origins:
According to the Kojiki, Raijin was born from the rotting corpse of Izanami no Mikoto specifically, from her chest, after she died giving birth to the fire god Kagutsuchi and descended into Yomi (the underworld). When her husband Izanagi went to retrieve her, he was horrified by her decaying appearance and fled, with Raijin and other thunder deities chasing him.

Appearance:
He is often portrayed as a muscular, fierce figure with red skin, a terrifying face, and wild hair blowing in the storm. Despite his frightening appearance, he is a protective figure who defends Japan against invaders and is credited with the "Divine Wind" (Kamikaze) that stopped the Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281.

Companions:
He is often accompanied by Fujin (the god of wind) and his son Raitaro (Thunder Boy).
